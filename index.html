                Some say the world will end in fire, <br>
                Some say in ice.<br>
                From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire, <br>
                I hold with those who favor fire. <br>
                But if it had to perish twice, <br>
                I think I know enough of hate.<br>
                To know that for destruction ice, <br>
                Is also great, <br>
                And would suffice.<br>
